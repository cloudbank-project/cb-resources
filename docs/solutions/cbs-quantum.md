CloudBank works to facilitate researchers learning and using quantum computing systems accessed through the public cloud (IBM, GCP, Azure, AWS, etcetera).
There are roughly four components to cloud quantum: Cloud infrastructure, coupling to a functional quantum system (often via alliances with third parties), 
development environments and simulators used for low-cost testing of quantum algorithms. The following notes indicate some searchable terminology; to 
be ugraded to more comprehensive material soon (MAR-2022).


* Azure cloud: **`Liqui|>`** quantum simulation; Q# quantum algorithm language; access to Honeywell and IonQ trapped ion quantum systems
* Google cloud (GCP): IonQ is available through the Google Cloud Marketplace. Get started on the Quantum Cloud API + Console
* AWS cloud: Braket, a fully managed service that helps you get started with quantum computing
* IBM cloud: IBM Quantum stack includes learning tools and community organization
