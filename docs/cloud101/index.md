# Overview

Our Cloud 101 video series is a conceptual introduction to the cloud from a researcher's perspective. For more detailed walkthroughs of technical content, see our [Cloudbank Solutions](../solutions/index.md).

The video series is split into six parts, reflecting at a coarse grain the topics that we keep in mind when using the cloud for a project. Videos range from 5-10 minutes in length, covering high-level concepts and showasing a few concrete examples to illustrate key ideas:
