# Technical Resources

Cloudbank's focus is on helping researchers and educators utilize the cloud as a tool for the work they're already doing. The resources in this section help you identify exactly how your work would look in the cloud, and the learning resources to get started on building it.

## Design Patterns

Here are some of the most common patterns we see appear in research cloud infrastructure. Follow the links for guides on how to map this work onto cloud services.
