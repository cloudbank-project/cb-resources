# Financial Resources

As a part of CloudBank's mission to make cloud platforms a viable resource for higher ed institutions, we provide assistance and support for towards getting funding for your cloud infrastructure. Read on to find out more about the process.

## ![Research icon]({{site.baseurl}}/static/financial-research.png) For researchers

For scientific research, CloudBank funds are awarded through the NSF as part of a larger project grant. To get these funds you must request them up-front with a **cloud supplement** in your NSF project proposal. The process for putting this supplement together looks something like this:

1. Check if the [NSF solicitation](eligible-nsf-solicitations) to which you're applying accepts CloudBank supplements.
2. Watch our [Cloud 101 video series](../cloud101) to get a sense of what cloud resources your project can take advantage of.
3. Put together a back-of-the-envelope cost estimate of these resources using our in-house [pricing calculator](cloud-calc).
4. Contact [CloudBank User Support](mailto:help@cloudbank.org) to go over your estimate and advise on moving forward.

For more detailed information about this funding model, see the [NSF FAQ](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20108/nsf20108.jsp).

If you're applying to an NSF solicitation that does not accept a CloudBank supplement, we encourage you to contact your NSF Program Officer and encourage them to support it in the future! Community interest and engagement is incredibly valuable in making cloud resources available where they're needed.

In partnership with [2I2C](https://2i2c.org/), CloudBank can provide educators with a managed web-based coding environment that can be used for homework assignments, guided lab activities, and more. The funding for this infrastructure comes from CloudBank community grants, which are offered on a rolling basis.
